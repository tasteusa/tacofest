I am a musician from northern Virginia and I am emailing today to see if you had any open slots available for music at this years Virginia Wine Festival.I have a variety of music that I play and can offer you.First off, I play in a three piece band (guitar, bass, and drums).  We play rock and roll, mainly hits from the 80s 90s and 2000s.  This year we have been playing all over the DC area and have become regulars at places such as Jammin Java, Gypsy Sallys, Tysons Biergarten, Westover Beer Garden, Arlington County Fair, and more.  Have been having lots of fun and success and I think that we would bring a lot of energy to the festival.Second, I am best known for headlining basketball halftime shows with my percussive style of guitar.  It is similar to John Butler, Kaki King, and Andy Mckee. We are also scheduled to play some upcoming festivals in the area.  The band has a large selections of songs so we are able to play for as long as you need.  Our longest gigs usually go four hours, but we are open to any amount of time that you can give us.  My music can be found at http://www.kevinjolson.com .  There is a link to the band subpage there as well.  Just wanted to throw my name out there if you were looking for entertainment.  We are all from the NOVA area so we could definitely bring a bunch of people to the event too.  Always have tons of fun and would love to come jam at this years Wine Festival!"

My name is John and there's something I'd like to tell you. I recently did a research on Instagram user statistics and likes/Follower patterns across users, and found out that many users such as yourself suffer from a state of placidity. This means that despite regularly uploaded good content you're unable to grow further. The reason is that most of the regular Instagram users only watch and follow content that seems popular, while overlooking or ignoring content that has a low number of likes compared to the other popular content they follow. Have you noticed that you hit a wall with your account and that regardless of what you do you only stay where you are? If not, it will become apparent to you soon.This is the reason why http://www.himzilikes.com was created. By using one of  our packages you can get above the threshold other users consider as unpopular and let your account grow to it's deserved follower size. Just select which package best suits you and your account and after less than 24 hours the package will be active.If you have any questions feel free to ask.Kind regardsJohn DerringHimziLikes Foreman"
